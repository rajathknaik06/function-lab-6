""" Hussain wants to create a program to calculate a person's BMI (Body Mass Index) based on their weight in kilograms and height in meters. The BMI is a measure of a person's body fat relative to their height.



Your program should take user input for weight and height, calculate the BMI, and display the result.



Function Signature: calculate_bmi(weight, height)



Formula: BMI = Weight/(Height)2

Input format :
The first line of input consists of a positive floating-point number, the person's weight in kilograms.

The second line of input consists of a positive floating-point number, the person's height in meters.

Output format :
The output displays "Your BMI is: [BM] followed by a float value representing the calculated BMI, rounded off two decimal points."""

def calculate_bmi(weight, height):
    bmi = weight / (height ** 2)
    return round(bmi, 2)

# Input from the user
weight = float(input())
height = float(input())

# Calculate BMI
bmi = calculate_bmi(weight, height)

# Display the result
print("Your BMI is:", bmi)
